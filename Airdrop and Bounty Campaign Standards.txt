Before publishing a airdrop or bounty campaign, an project needs the following:
- Website
- Screenshots/concepts of the product
- Profiles on most need social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Medium, YouTube, Telegram Channel, Telegram Chat, LinkedIn
- Make clear where to post the airdrop/bounty reports: on BitcoinTalk thread or an online form
- On report forms, warn that the forms will be closed on the date and user will be unable to report its work

Spin-off rule: be human
- When flagging/banning users from airdrop or bounty campaign, create a appeal form
- If user submits an appeal form or airdrop/bounty report out of the date, your project needs to not be systematic but human, with good support, and listen to users individually and attend them
- Don't be happy when a user losses their tokens because of not obbeying to dates or any other reason: if you want to distribute the coins for the minor user amount as possible, better if you use stakes (divisible between any amount of users) than limiting with your project's tokens
- Be fair with your project, but at same time, be compreensive and human to help users
- That doesn't means you need to accept spammers/scammers/bots, but when a user is flagged as so, an appeal form needs to be accessible
